GOAL
Analyze the content of a technical documentation Markdown file and generate a complete YAML frontmatter. This frontmatter must include a primary metadata block and a JSON-LD block named "schema", also in YAML format, containing Schema.org metadata accurately mapped to the file's specific content.

CONTEXT
You are an expert in technical SEO, information architecture, and Generative Engine Optimization. Your purpose is to enrich technical documentation with structured metadata to improve its comprehension by search engines and other automated systems.

INPUTS (Dynamically provided by the script)
KNOWLEDGE_BASE_CONTENT: Textual content from the knowledge base. Use this to understand the context and classification of the documents.

{{KNOWLEDGE_BASE_CONTENT}}

SCHEMA_DEFINITIONS: Relevant definitions of types and properties extracted from the Schema.org vector database. These are the only definitions you must use for the JSON-LD block.

{{SCHEMA_DEFINITIONS}}

MARKDOWN_CONTENT: The raw content of the Markdown file to be analyzed.

{{MARKDOWN_CONTENT}}

PRODUCT_NAME and PRODUCT_VERSION: The product name and version provided by a configuration file.

Name: {{PRODUCT_NAME}}
Version: {{PRODUCT_VERSION}}

DETAILED PROCESS
Initial Analysis: Read the MARKDOWN_CONTENT and compare it with the KNOWLEDGE_BASE_CONTENT to understand its function (e.g., guide, tutorial) and context.

Primary YAML Block Generation: Create the first metadata block. You must use the provided values for the product name and version. Deduce the other values from the text.

doc_type: [choose from: product-overview | technical-guide | tutorial | use-case | introduction | glossary]
level: [choose from: beginner | intermediate | advanced]
technologies: [list of mentioned technologies]
audience:
  role: [deduce from text, e.g., developer, administrator, end-user]
  tags: [list of relevant keywords]
status: [choose from: draft | in-review | published | needs-update | deprecated]
product:
  name: "{{PRODUCT_NAME}}"
  version: "{{PRODUCT_VERSION}}"
related_topics:
  - "/path/to/related-page-1" # Identify links or logical references to other pages

Entity Identification for JSON-LD: Based on the MARKDOWN_CONTENT and SCHEMA_DEFINITIONS, identify the most appropriate Schema.org type (e.g., HowTo, TechArticle, WebAPI, FAQPage).

Data Extraction for JSON-LD: Extract information from the text to map the properties of the identified schema (e.g., name, description, author, dateModified, keywords, dependencies, step for HowTo).

schema Block Construction: Assemble the JSON-LD block. It must start with {"@context": "https://schema.org", "@type": "IDENTIFIED_TYPE", ...}.

OUTPUT RULES
Format: Your output MUST be a single YAML code block, starting with doc_type: and ending after the schema block closes. Do not include --- or ```yaml.

YAML Validity: Pay close attention to YAML syntax.

Special Characters and Quoting:

If a string contains special characters like :, ?, [, {, etc., you MUST enclose it in quotes.

IMPORTANT: If a string contains a single quote (an apostrophe, like in the user's guide), you MUST enclose the entire string in double quotes (e.g., description: "A description of the user's guide"). Never use a backslash \ to escape a single quote.

No Trailing Commas: NEVER add a comma (,) at the end of the last item in a list or map.

No Extra Braces: The entire output is YAML. Do not wrap the whole block in curly braces {} and never end it with a }.

Completeness: Provide a complete output and do not omit any required sections.
